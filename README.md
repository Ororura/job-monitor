# Job Monitor

A single-user local application for collecting and reviewing job vacancies.
This development foundation starts Spring Boot, creates a SQLite database, and
applies Flyway migrations. Vacancy collection, scheduling, APIs, and UI are not
implemented yet; the existing feature files remain placeholders.

## Requirements

- Java 25 LTS JDK, without preview features; Eclipse Temurin is preferred.
- macOS on Apple Silicon or Fedora Linux (x86_64 / ARM64).
- Use the checked-in Gradle 9.6.0 wrapper; no system Gradle is required.
- The first build needs network access to download dependencies.

Install a JDK 25 matching your OS and architecture using the
[Temurin installation instructions](https://adoptium.net/installation).
On macOS, select the installed JDK with `export JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home -v 25)`.
On Fedora, set `JAVA_HOME` to the installed JDK directory. In either case, set
`export PATH="$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH"` and verify `java -version` and `./gradlew --version`.
SQLite's native libraries for macOS ARM64 and Linux are bundled in the JDBC jar;
a separate SQLite installation is optional.

## Run

```sh
./gradlew bootRun
```

The server listens on `127.0.0.1:8080`. No UI or business endpoints exist yet, so
an HTTP 404 at `/` is expected. Stop the application with Ctrl+C.

The data directory is created automatically before opening `job-monitor.db`:

| OS | Default directory |
| --- | --- |
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/job-monitor/` |
| Fedora / Linux | `$XDG_DATA_HOME/job-monitor/` when XDG_DATA_HOME is an absolute path; otherwise `~/.local/share/job-monitor/` |

To override it, use an absolute directory outside the Git working tree:

```sh
JOB_MONITOR_DATA_DIR="/absolute/path/to/job-monitor" ./gradlew bootRun
```

`job-monitor.data-directory` can also be set through Spring configuration, e.g.
`./gradlew bootRun --args='--job-monitor.data-directory=/absolute/path/to/job-monitor'`.
Spring Boot does not automatically load `.env` files; export environment variables
in the shell or configure them in the IDE.

Application settings are in `src/main/resources/application.yml`. The SQLite URL
is derived from the data directory by `DataSourceConfiguration`; the Hikari pool
uses one connection, enables foreign keys, and sets a five-second SQLite lock
timeout. `SERVER_PORT` overrides the default port. Run only one application
instance against a database file.

Flyway validates and applies `src/main/resources/db/migration/V*__*.sql` on startup.
`V1__initialize_database.sql` creates a small infrastructure metadata table, with
no vacancy domain schema. Add a new migration for each schema change; never edit
an applied migration. Repeated startup keeps existing data and does not reapply V1.

## Verification and build

```sh
./gradlew spotlessApply
./gradlew spotlessCheck
./gradlew check
./gradlew build
```

`check` runs tests, Spotless, PMD, and SpotBugs; failures fail the build.
Reports are written under `build/reports/`. Tests use temporary SQLite files
outside the repository and do not access the user's database or external websites.
The integration test starts the HTTP server, verifies migration history, reads and
writes through Spring JDBC, and checks that another migration pass is a no-op.
Unit tests cover macOS/Linux default paths, XDG_DATA_HOME, and an explicit override.

Build output includes `build/libs/job-monitor-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`:

```sh
java --enable-native-access=ALL-UNNAMED -jar build/libs/job-monitor-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

Native access is enabled for the SQLite JDBC native library; Gradle's `bootRun`
and test tasks already set that option.

GitHub Actions runs the same three verification commands with Temurin 25 on
Ubuntu Linux and macOS ARM64. Fedora uses the same Linux JDBC natives and path
resolution; a native Fedora run is still needed to validate that specific host.

## Versions and compatibility

| Component | Version |
| --- | --- |
| Java toolchain | 25 |
| Gradle wrapper | 9.6.0 |
| Spring Boot | 4.1.1 |
| SQLite JDBC | 3.53.4.0 |
| Flyway | 12.4.0 (Spring Boot BOM) |
| JUnit Jupiter | 6.0.3 (Spring Boot BOM) |
| Spotless / google-java-format | 8.10.4 / 1.36.1 |
| PMD | 7.28.0 |
| SpotBugs plugin / engine | 6.5.13 / 4.10.5 |

JUnit 6 was chosen instead of the initial JUnit 5 requirement because
[Spring Framework 7's SpringExtension requires JUnit Jupiter 6](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/7.0.9/javadoc-api/org/springframework/test/context/junit/jupiter/SpringExtension.html).
Spring Boot's BOM manages the Spring and testing dependencies. SQLite support is
included in this Flyway core version; no additional database module is required.

source integrations are not enabled by this foundation. Follow `AGENTS.md`
when implementing subsequent MVP features.
